### Null Hypothesis Formulation:

Both the null and alternate hypothesis have been formulated correctly in words and also in terms of mathematical expression.

### Data:

* The data has the appropriate features to answer the question.

* Preprocessed data shows the whether the day of the ride was a weekend or a weekday, along with the day of the week.


### Testing The Hypothesis:

#### Ho: The proportion of people that bike during the weekends is more or the same to the proportion of people that bike on weekdays

#### Data: Citibike data preprocessed to generate samples by weekdays and weekends.

* Since we are comparing two samples from the same population which is the citibike dataset, the two-proportion z-test could be used to test the hypothesis. 

* We can then assess whether there is any statistical difference between the two samples.


### Suggestion(s):

* It would be interesting to see whether the trend holds true across the various boroughs of New York. 

* By capturing the riding habits, citibike can make provision for the bikes according to where the bulk of the riders based on the   day of the week and place.
